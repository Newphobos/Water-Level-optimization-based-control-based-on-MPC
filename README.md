Water Level optimization based control based on MPC

The equations given in the state models.m represent the model of the Lake Toke that has been used by the Skagerak Energi for the hydroplant operation.

This Optimal COntrol solution is based on the maximization of water levels in the Lake Toke, so that the operation remains unhindered due to lack of water supply to the turbine.
Mortheremore, this solution gives the control signal that can be used on the flood gates of the hydrpower plant when there is possibility of flood in the lake.


Overall, the levels are maximized( variables of interest are optimized) and the flood gates are controlled with optimized control signal.
